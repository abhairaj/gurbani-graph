I'd like you to generate some TTL for me

Find the ontology here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhairaj/gurbani-graph/refs/heads/feature/poc_01/ttl/ontology.ttl

I have reference data here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhairaj/gurbani-graph/refs/heads/feature/poc_01/ttl/reference.ttl and themes here: and themes here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhairaj/gurbani-graph/refs/heads/feature/poc_01/ttl/themes.ttl

Here's a good shabd instance exmaple I've alreay implemented: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhairaj/gurbani-graph/refs/heads/feature/poc_01/ttl/japji_pauri10.ttl 

A key thing to note is the granularity of the GlossUnit instances. I'd like them to be decompositions of a Tuk where they encapsulate semantically meaningful phrases - usually just a few words or a single word

Also, please feel free to generate new Themes.

The shabd I'm interested in starts on SGGS Ang ? with Tuk ? and ends on Ang ? with Tuk ?
